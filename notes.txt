** Run migrations whenever the db model has been updated **

Database migrations: 
flask db migrate -> automatically creates a migration script
flask db upgrade -> applies the changes from migration script
flask db downgrade -> undoes the last migration

Database schemas: 
User and Posts are linked. Foreign keys are keys that are created by taking values 
from another schema.
	 ie.) Posts has user_id column, the value would be taken from the id of User.

Database syntax:
__repr__: String representaion of the table's value
